                    <h3>Automated Fare and Passenger Management System</h3>
                    <p>The created fare and passenger management system is a web-based system that has registration for three (3) different users: Admin, Driver, and Passenger. It has all the capabilities, such as automating the traditional way of paying fares in commuting using QR codes and built-in QR Scanner, reducing the delay of their time, can calculate exact amount of fare, students/senior citizen/PWD discount, and saved a lot of time either collecting fare or processing reports. The system can also be used to track number of customers and transactions in a daily basis.
                         The level of the usability of the Automated Fare Management in terms of design, functionality, usability and security was very acceptable. </p>

                    <h3>Information Technology Student Organization Voting System</h3>
                    <p>
                        The system was developed for 8 hours. It was mainly used in the election of the Information Technology Student Organization Officers 2023.
                        It was made rushed so the front end part is not so good looking. This system is always available to use in any elections of the school,
                        just a few tweaks is needed.
